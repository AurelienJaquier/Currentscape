Introduction
============

Currentscape is a Pythonic API enabling scientists to easily plot 
currentscapes figures in the style of 
`Leandro M. Alonso and Eve Marder, (2019) <https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.d0779mb>`_
, given the currents and voltage traces of an in-silico neuron cell.
Currentscape figures plot the percentage of each inward and outward ionic current,
the total inward and outward currents, as well as the voltage in function of time.
This API is useful to see what current plays a major (or a minor) role at a given time,
and see in depth the currents dynamics.

This API is based on the code provided by the susmentioned paper.
